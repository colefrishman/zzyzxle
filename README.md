## FAQ

### How can I change the length of a guess?

The default configuration is for solutions and guesses of length five, but it is flexible enough to handle other lengths, even variable lengths each day.

To configure for a different constant length:

- Update the `WORDS` array in [src/constants/wordlist.ts](src/constants/wordlist.ts) to only include words of the new length.
- Update the `VALID_GUESSES` array in [src/constants/validGuesses.ts](src/constants/validGuesses.ts) to only include words of the new length.

To configure for variable lengths:

- Update the `WORDS` array in [src/constants/wordlist.ts](src/constants/wordlist.ts) to include words of any of the variable lengths desired.
- Update the `VALID_GUESSES` array in [src/constants/validGuesses.ts](src/constants/validGuesses.ts) to include words of any of the variable lengths desired.

Note that guesses are validated against both the length of the solution, and presence in VALID_GUESSES.

### How can I add usage tracking?

This repository includes support for Google Analytics or [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), but, by default, this is disabled.

To enable Google Analytics:

- Create a Google Analytics 4 property and obtain the measurement ID (of the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`

Keep in mind that your region might have legislation about obtaining a user's consent before enabling trackers. This is up to downstream repos to implement.

To enable Plausible Analytics:

- Create a new website with Plausible Analytics with a given domain, e.g. `example.app`
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=example.app`

### Why does sharing of results not work?

For mobile and wearable devices and smart TVs, sharing of results is initially attempted using the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API). For other devices or when sharing to the Web Share API fails, the results are written to the clipboard. Both these methods will succeed only in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), which require you to implement the HTTPS protocol when hosting this repo on a public domain.
